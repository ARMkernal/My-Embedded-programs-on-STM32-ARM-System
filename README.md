## My-Embedded-programs-on-STM32-ARM-System
This is the assignments I completed on the course Embedded Systems and Microprocessing in Sustech.  
Embedded Systems and Microprocessing course number: CS301  
# Running platform: Keil uVision 5  
There are several projects in this repository. 
Since different projects have different dependencies, there maybe compilation errors if you download my code and run it in your own project. 
If you got compilation error in the project, you can extract the main.c file into your project and try compiling in your only uVision project. 
# Notice
Some of the Chinese remarks are garbled in the projects!
